## Asset Pipeline — New Track

A hybrid Python + C track. The pipeline is a **reusable Python library** at
`pipeline/` in the repo root (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`). Each lesson adds
real functionality to the shared package. Processing plugins that need
high-performance C libraries (meshoptimizer, MikkTSpace) are compiled C tools
invoked as subprocesses. Procedural geometry generation lives in a header-only
C library (`common/shapes/forge_shapes.h`).

- [ ] **Asset Lesson 05 — Asset Bundles** — Packing multiple processed assets into bundle files; table of contents with offsets for random access; compression (zstd); dependency tracking between assets

### Project Integration

Once the core pipeline lessons (02–05) are complete, wire it up to the
project's actual assets:

- [ ] **Add a root `pipeline.toml`** pointing at the existing `assets/` tree:

  ```toml
  [pipeline]
  source_dir = "assets"
  output_dir = "assets/processed"
  cache_dir  = ".forge-cache"

  [texture]
  max_size = 2048
  generate_mipmaps = true

  [mesh]
  deduplicate = true
  generate_tangents = true
  ```

- [ ] **Process existing models** — Suzanne, Duck, CesiumMilkTruck, BoxTextured,
  CesiumMan, space-shuttle OBJ through the mesh plugin (dedup, tangents, LODs)
- [ ] **Process existing textures** — model textures (BaseColor, Normal,
  MetallicRoughness PNGs), skybox cube map faces, font atlases through the
  texture plugin (resize, mipmaps, compression)
- [ ] **Update GPU lessons to load processed assets** — swap raw asset paths for
  processed bundle/output paths so lessons benefit from optimized geometry and
  compressed textures
- [ ] **Add `.forge-cache/` to `.gitignore`** — fingerprint cache is local state
- [ ] **Add `assets/processed/` to `.gitignore`** — outputs are reproducible from
  source assets and should not be committed
- [ ] **CI integration** — run `python -m pipeline` in CI to verify all assets
  process without errors; fail the build on processing regressions

- [ ] **Asset Lesson 09 — Scene Editor** — Visual scene composition: place, move, rotate, scale objects; save scene graph as JSON/glTF; integration with the C runtime for live preview; undo/redo with command pattern
