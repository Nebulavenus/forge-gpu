argument-hint: [pr-number]

Check GitHub Actions status, review feedback from automated reviewers (Code Rabbit,
Claude), implement or respond to feedback, and merge the PR when all feedback is
resolved.

The user provides:

- **PR number**: the pull request number to review (optional - infers from current branch)

## Workflow

### 1. Check GitHub Actions status

Use `gh pr checks <pr-number>` to see if automated reviews are complete.

**Important:** This command returns exit code 8 if any checks are pending, and
outputs them to stderr. Handle both stdout and stderr to capture all check statuses.

Output format: `check-name  status  duration  url`

**If any checks are still running (pending):**

- Report which checks are pending
- Exit with message: "GitHub Actions still running. Run this skill again when checks complete."
- DO NOT sleep or wait — let the user run the skill again later

**If checks failed:**

- Report which checks failed
- Show the failure URL from the output
- **If markdown linting failed**, offer to run it locally and fix issues (see step 1.5)
- Otherwise exit and ask user to investigate

**If all checks passed:**

- Proceed to step 2 (fetch review comments)

### 1.5. Fix markdown linting failures (if needed)

If the "Markdown Lint" check failed:

1. **Run locally to see errors:**

   ```bash
   npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"
   ```

2. **Attempt auto-fix:**

   ```bash
   npx markdownlint-cli2 --fix "**/*.md"
   ```

3. **Manually fix remaining errors** (especially MD040 - missing language tags)

4. **Verify all errors resolved:**

   ```bash
   npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"
   ```

5. **Commit and push fixes:**

   ```bash
   git add <fixed-files>
   git commit -m "Fix markdown linting errors

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   git push
   ```

6. **Exit and wait for checks to re-run** — user should invoke `/review-pr` again after checks pass

### 2. Fetch review comments

**Important:** Inline review comments (the "tasks" users see in the GitHub UI)
are NOT returned by `gh pr view --json comments`. You must use the API directly:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr-number}/comments
```

This returns an array of review comment objects with:

- `path` — file path
- `line` / `start_line` — line numbers
- `body` — comment body (markdown, may include severity, suggestions)
- `html_url` — link to view the conversation
- `user.login` — reviewer (e.g., "coderabbitai[bot]", "claude-code[bot]")

**CodeRabbit comment format:**

- Body starts with severity: `_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_`, `_🟡 Minor_`, or other markers
- Includes suggested fixes in `<details><summary>Suggested fix</summary>` blocks
- May include committable suggestions between `<!-- suggestion_start -->` markers
- **Important:** CodeRabbit may leave nitpick/style comments alongside major issues—fetch ALL comments, not just the first few

Parse and categorize feedback by:

- Severity (🟠 Major, 🟡 Minor, nitpick/style)
- File and line number
- Reviewer (CodeRabbit, Claude, human)

**Present ALL comments to the user** sorted by severity (Major → Minor → Nitpick) so security/critical issues are addressed first.

### 3. Present feedback summary

**Sort comments by severity:** Major → Minor → Nitpick/Style, so critical issues (especially security) are addressed first.

Show the user:

```text
## PR Review Feedback Summary

### Pending conversations: X

**Major issues (🟠):**
1. **[CodeRabbit]** file.c:123
   > Security: Anyone can trigger this workflow
   [View](https://github.com/...)

**Minor issues (🟡):**
2. **[CodeRabbit]** README.md:45
   > Style: Add language tag to code block
   [View](https://github.com/...)

**Nitpicks/Style:**
3. **[Claude]** main.c:100
   > Consider adding a comment here
   [View](https://github.com/...)

### Resolved conversations: Y
```

If no pending conversations, skip to step 6.

### 4. Handle each piece of feedback

For each pending conversation, ask the user:

```text
Feedback from [Reviewer] on file.c:123:
> [feedback text]

How should I handle this?
1. Implement the suggestion (I'll make the code changes)
2. Respond and resolve (you explain why it's not applicable)
3. Skip for now (handle later)
```

Use AskUserQuestion with options:

- "Implement" - Make the code changes, commit, push
- "Respond and resolve" - Ask user for response text, post comment, resolve conversation
- "Skip" - Move to next feedback

### 5. After implementing changes

If any code changes were made:

- Stage changes
- Create commit: "Address PR feedback: [summary]"
- Push to the PR branch
- Re-run checks with `gh pr checks` (don't wait, just show status)
- Exit with: "Changes pushed. Run this skill again after checks complete."

**On next run after CodeRabbit re-reviews:**

- Check if comments are auto-resolved (CodeRabbit detects implemented fixes)
- If still unresolved after implementing the suggested fix:
  - Mention CodeRabbit in a comment: "@coderabbitai I've implemented your suggestion in commit ABC123. Can you verify and resolve this conversation?"
  - OR if CodeRabbit's check is complete (not currently running): "@coderabbitai Why hasn't this been auto-resolved? Is there an issue with my implementation?"
  - If CodeRabbit is still checking: wait for it to finish before asking

### 6. Check if ready to merge

Use `gh pr view <pr-number> --json reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup` to verify:

- All conversations are resolved
- All status checks pass
- PR has approval (reviewDecision = "APPROVED")

**If not ready:**

- Report what's blocking (conversations, checks, approval)
- Exit with instructions

**If ready:**

- Proceed to step 7

### 7. Merge the PR

Ask user for confirmation:

```text
✅ All feedback resolved, all checks passing, PR approved.

Ready to merge PR #X: "Title"
Branch: lesson-03-uniforms-and-motion → main

Merge method:
1. Squash and merge (recommended for lessons)
2. Merge commit
3. Rebase and merge
```

After user confirmation:

```bash
gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch
```

Show success message with merged commit SHA.

## GitHub CLI commands reference

```bash
# Check PR status (returns exit code 8 if checks are pending)
gh pr checks <pr-number>

# Get inline review comments (the "tasks" shown in GitHub UI)
# IMPORTANT: This is the correct way to fetch review feedback
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr-number}/comments

# View PR details (does NOT include inline review comments)
gh pr view <pr-number> --json reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup

# View specific workflow run
gh run view <run-id>

# Reply to a specific review comment thread (CORRECT - creates nested reply)
# Use this to respond to CodeRabbit/Claude feedback on specific lines
# IMPORTANT: Must include PR number in path - repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr-number}/comments/{comment-id}/replies
# Example: gh api repos/RosyGameStudio/forge-gpu/pulls/1/comments/2807683534/replies
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr-number}/comments/{comment-id}/replies \
  -f body="response text"

# Post a general PR comment (AVOID - doesn't thread properly with review feedback)
# This creates a standalone comment, not a reply to a review thread
gh pr comment <pr-number> --body "response text"

# Ask CodeRabbit to verify/resolve after implementing a fix (reply to the comment thread)
# IMPORTANT: Must include PR number in the path (not just comment ID)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr-number}/comments/{comment-id}/replies \
  -f body="@coderabbitai I've implemented your suggestion in commit ABC123. Can you verify and resolve this conversation?"

# Resolve a review thread manually
# Note: GitHub CLI doesn't directly support this - may need gh api or manual UI resolution
# Usually let CodeRabbit auto-resolve when it re-reviews

# Merge PR
gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch
```

## Implementation notes

- **Never sleep or wait** — if actions are running, exit and tell user to re-run
- Can be run multiple times — each run picks up where it left off
- Commit messages for feedback changes should reference the PR number
- If Code Rabbit or Claude give conflicting advice, prioritize project conventions from CLAUDE.md
- Always show the user what will be changed before making code modifications
- Use the same commit message format as publish-lesson (with Co-Authored-By line)
- **The "X out of Y pending tasks"** shown in GitHub UI are the unresolved review comment threads—fetch them via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr-number}/comments`
- **CodeRabbit auto-resolution:** CodeRabbit automatically resolves conversations when it detects the suggested fix was implemented in a new commit. Let it auto-resolve; only ask it to resolve manually if it doesn't detect your fix after re-review.
- **Reply to comment threads:** Always use `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr-number}/comments/{comment-id}/replies` to reply to specific review comments. This keeps conversations threaded. Do NOT use `gh pr comment` for replies—it creates unthreaded general comments.
  - **Common mistake:** Forgetting to include the PR number in the path (e.g., `repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{id}/replies` won't work—must be `pulls/{pr-number}/comments/{id}/replies`)

## Error handling

- If `gh` CLI is not installed or not authenticated, provide clear setup instructions
- If PR doesn't exist, report error
- If branch has conflicts, report and exit (user must resolve manually)
- If merge is blocked by branch protection rules, report the blocking rules

## Future enhancements

- Auto-detect if feedback is trivial (typos, formatting) and batch implement
- Learn from resolved conversations to avoid similar issues in future lessons
- Generate summary of what was changed for the PR merge commit message
